### Map Design and Tile Generation

This is the link to my finished [Map Design](https://nlertv.github.io/webmap/)


The examined geographical area is mainly Seattle, Washington and the surrounding cities. Since, I lived in Seattle, I though it would be interesting to learn more about the city and things it has to offer. The data I chose was regarding Licensed Acute Care Hospitals, which was surprising to me because there was not that many in the area.

#### Base Level

For this base map, I chose to focus on Seattle and the surrounding cities in WA state. I chose a monochrome base map with the customization color blue. The zoom level is between 0 to 14. This is the first tile it is provided by MapBox.

#### Licensed Acute Care Hospital

For the second tile, it is a thematic map layer with the dataset of Licensed Acute care hospital. I thought it would be interesting to see the distribution of the acute care hospital around Seattle. Therefore, I chose to display this data. The zoom level on this map is also from 0 to 14. 

#### Base Map & Data

This third tile is a layer that composed of a thematic layer and the base map layer. Hence, the map is blue. It is very similar to the map displayed in tile two. The zoom level is also from 0 to 14.

#### Ocean Awareness

This fourth tile is a layer that is designed on Mapbox. The theme for this map is Ocean Awareness or Ocean Protection. It is important to keep the ocean clean from plastic pollution. Therefore, I choose the theme to be light blue to represent clear water free of plastic and trash. The zoom level on this map is also from 0 to 14.
